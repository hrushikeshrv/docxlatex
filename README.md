# docxlatex
A python library for extracting text from .docx files with LaTeX support

Influenced by [python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) and [python-docx2txt](https://github.com/ankushshah89/python-docx2txt).
This project aims to expand the above libraries' functionality by allowing you to extract the equations in a .docx file and converts them to valid LaTeX, 
primarily for use with MathJax.

docxlatex DOES NOT convert the entire .docx file to a LaTeX source file.
