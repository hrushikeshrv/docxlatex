# Specification
This collection of files details the OMML tags (i.e. the types of equations) that docxlatex will support, 
will not support, and will ignore. There are a total of 124 math tags defined in the formal ECMA specification
for OMML.  

Supported tags will be extracted and converted into LaTeX correctly, unsupported tags will be 
extracted but may not convert to LaTeX correctly, and ignored tags will not be extracted.
