Description: # docxlatex
        A python library for extracting text from .docx files with LaTeX support
        
        Influenced by [python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) and [python-docx2txt](https://github.com/ankushshah89/python-docx2txt).
        This project aims to expand the above libraries' functionality by allowing you to extract the equations in a .docx file and converts them to valid LaTeX, 
        primarily for use with MathJax.
        
        docxlatex DOES NOT convert the entire .docx file to a LaTeX source file.
        
        # Installation
        Install using pip  
        `pip install docxlatex`
        
        # Usage
        
        Import the `Document` class from `docxlatex`
        
        ```python
        from docxlatex import Document
        ```
        
        Create a `Document` object, giving it the path to the .docx file, and call the `get_text()` method
        ```python
        doc = Document("path/to/document")
        text = doc.get_text()
        ```
        
        You can also set some settings on the `Document` object to customize behaviour, like setting the delimiters that will go before and after an equation, 
        and flags to extract header and footer text.
        
        ```python
        doc.get_header_text = True # False by default
        doc.get_footer_text = True # False by default
        doc.inline_delimiter = "%" # "$" by default
        doc.block_delimiter = "%%" # "$$" by default
        ```
        
        # Limitation
        docxlatex currently requires all the mathematical equations in the .docx document to be converted into linear format to extract successfully. I am adding support for 
        equations in the professional format right now. Future releases will let you use it without having to use this workaround, but for now, make sure all the equations in the .docx file are converted into linear form.  
        
        To convert all your equations into linear format, click on any equation, go to the Equation tab, make sure LaTeX is selected, and click on Convert > All - Linear
        
        # TODOs
        - [ ] Extract all images present in the file and return them as file-like objects
        - [ ] Add support for equations in professional formatting
        - [ ] Clean up equations in linear format that do not directly convert to valid LaTeX
